"""
gen_dependency_tree.py — Emit the #include graph of the OCUDU source tree as YAML.

Scans every source file under the project's source roots and records what each
one includes, resolving each directive against the including file's own
directory first and then the repo's fixed, unconditional include roots
(the ones CMakeLists.txt adds via a plain `include_directories()`, independent
of any ENABLE_* option: `include`, `external/fmt/include`, `external`).

The scan against source roots covers every file regardless of build configuration
(unlike a compiler-flag-driven resolver, such as compile_commands.json), at the
cost of not being compiler-exact for the conditionally-added system search paths.

Output is a flat per-file adjacency map: each edge is the resolved
repo-relative path plus the line number of the #include that produced it, so
a consumer can re-read that exact line for anything (a raw include-path
convention check) this tool doesn't itself interpret. Unresolved directives
are kept separately, by line, rather than silently dropped.

Usage:
  python3 gen_dependency_tree.py [options]

Options:
  --repo <path>              Project root. Default: git toplevel of the cwd.
  --output <path>            Output file. Default: <repo>/ocudu_dependency_tree.yml.
  --roots <dir> [...]        Source roots to scan, repo-relative. Default:
                             every top-level directory holding sources, minus
                             the excludes.
  --exclude <pattern> [...]  Extra top-level names to skip (glob, matched
                             against the directory name).
  --quiet                    Suppress the summary line on stderr.

Exit codes:
  0  tree written
  2  bad input (unreadable repo, empty scan)
