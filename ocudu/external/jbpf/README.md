Userspace eBPF instrumentation and control framework for deploying control and monitoring functions in a secure manner. It is part of [Project Janus](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/programmable-ran-platform/) and provides probes for eBPF-like functionality outside of the Linux kernel.


# Architectural overview

![Architectural overview](docs/jbpf_oss_architecture.png)

The overall jbpf architecture is shown in the figure above. It consists of the following main components:
* **Application**: It is a user-provided executable that we want to instrument and control, built so that it is linked with the libjbpf library.
* **jbpf library**: The library that provides the functionality of deploying and executing codeletes, sending output data (output API) and receiving control data (input API).
* **Management framework**: This a framework to load/unload codelets (*codelet life-cycle management* and *secure codelet store*), collect telemetry and excert control (*data collection and control*) and build and deploy codelets (*codelet management*).

jbpf is not prescriptive in how the management framework should be built. It provides several APIs in the form of libraries: [`libjbpf_lcm`](docs/life_cycle_management.md) (life-cycle management), [`libjbpf_io`](docs/data_io.md) (input and output API) and [`libjbpf_verifier`](docs/verifier.md) (extended verifier), and a sample implementation of the management framework using the APIs. It expects that each user will use the APIs to integrate jbpf into their own prodution environment. 

For a high-level overview of the framework functionality, please read [this](./docs/overview.md). 



# Getting started

To build the library, [install the dependencies](./docs/dependencies.md), and run the following:
```
source ./setup_jbpf_env.sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j
```
Check [here](./CMakeLists.txt) to see build options. 

Then follow [these](./examples/first_example_standalone/README.md) steps to run a simple example and read [here](./docs/understand_first_codelet.md) to understand the example better.
Other variants of this example can be found [here](./examples/first_example_ipc/) and [here](./examples/reverse_proxy/).

## Doxygen documentation
You can generate the documentation using Doxygen. To do so, run the following:
```
make doc
```

The documentation will be generated in the `$OUT_DIR/docs/html` directory.


## Supported architectures
jbpf supports both x86_64 and aarch64. However, jbpf uses ubpf to run userspace eBPF code, and ubpf does not support atomics for ARM. Therefore, users compiling for ARM should be aware that certain functionailities of jbpf will not be available.
