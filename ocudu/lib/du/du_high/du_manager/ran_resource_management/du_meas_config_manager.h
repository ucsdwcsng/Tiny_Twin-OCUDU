/// a strict no-collision config, falling back to a loose one that checks that at least every other periodic UL occasion
/// does not collide with the measurement gap after MGRP is increased (doubled). As a last resort it returns a

/// NTN cell T_TA sweeps several slots over a pass. A UL occasion left clear here can therefore drift into the gap
