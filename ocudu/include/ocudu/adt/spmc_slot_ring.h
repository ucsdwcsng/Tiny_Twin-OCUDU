/// \brief Ring buffer of key-tagged entries with single-producer, multiple-consumer concurrent access.
///
/// Each entry is addressed by an integer key (typically derived from a slot point) that maps to a ring index via
/// \c key % size. An entry carries the key it currently holds, so a read for a key whose slot has already been recycled
/// by the ring wrap-around correctly misses instead of returning stale data. Callers are responsible for deriving the
/// key from their own index type.
///
/// Access to an entry is mediated by a lock-free try-rwlock:
/// - A single producer calls write() to take exclusive access to an entry.
/// - Multiple consumers may call read() and hold shared access to the same entry concurrently.
/// - When the producer wraps around the ring and catches up with consumers still reading an aliasing slot, the
///   acquisition fails and an empty handle is returned. Acquisitions never block; the caller decides how to react
///   to such an overflow.
///
/// Acquisition is exposed through RAII handles (\ref reader / \ref writer) that release the entry on destruction.
///
/// \tparam T Per-entry payload. Must be default-constructible. The ring tags entries with their key but never touches
///           the payload; resetting and populating it is the caller's responsibility.
/// \note Technically, this is not a lock-free container. If a reader thread preempts while holding a slot, the writer
/// cannot write to it. However, the plan is to use this container in a such a way that readers rarely contend with
/// the writer, and vice-versa. It's mostly a protection mechanism.
